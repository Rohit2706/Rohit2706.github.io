# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}**,<br>

I am an undergraduate student pursuing BE (Hons) in Computer Science at BITS Pilani, India. I am an **Upcoming SWE intern** at [Nutanix, Bangalore](https://www.nutanix.com/en) and have previously worked as an **SDE intern 2020** at [Samsung Resarch Institute - Bangalore](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b). I have always been enthusiastic about recent trends in Computer Science and keenly interested in the domains of **Biomedical Imaging, Computer Vision and Deep Learning, and Blockchain Development**.

I also like to spend my time on solving algorithmic problems on online platforms like codeforces and LeetCode.

I have also done [projects](../projects) in the domains of:
* Human Detection and Segmentation
* Deep Photo Style Transfer
* Image Segmentation
* Compiler Design
and others...

#### **Entropy-Based Distance Metric (EBDM)**<br>
Publication date: Jan 26, 2020  Published at: PyPi

Implemented the research paper ‘A Unified Entropy-Based Distance Metric for Ordinal-and-Nominal-Attribute Data Clustering’ by Zhang et al. and built a python package for finding a common distance matrix for the ordinal and nominal data from any kind of questionnaire data, based on entropy measures. Tested the package on multiple datasets for robustness.
