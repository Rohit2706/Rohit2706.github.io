#### **Patent (Nutanix): Technique for improved oplog flushing**<br>
Filing date: June, 2024  File at: US and India Patent Offices

Patent forimproving temporary write buffer(oplog) flushing, achieving eightfold performance gains by optimizing drain
speeds for consistent I/O performance during various states (e.g., idle,rebuild) when serviced by the persistent storage
tier or SSD-based oplog.

#### **Entropy-Based Distance Metric (EBDM)**<br>
Publication date: Jan 26, 2020  Published at: PyPi

Implemented the research paper ‘A Unified Entropy-Based Distance Metric for Ordinal-and-Nominal-Attribute Data Clustering’ by Zhang et al. and built a python package for finding a common distance matrix for the ordinal and nominal data from any kind of questionnaire data, based on entropy measures. Tested the package on multiple datasets for robustness.
