#### **Entropy-Based Distance Metric (EBDM)**<br>
Publication date: Jan 26, 2020  Published at: PyPi

Implemented the research paper ‘A Unified Entropy-Based Distance Metric for Ordinal-and-Nominal-Attribute Data Clustering’ by Zhang et al. and built a python package for finding a common distance matrix for the ordinal and nominal data from any kind of questionnaire data, based on entropy measures. Tested the package on multiple datasets for robustness.
