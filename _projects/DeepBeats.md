# About the Project

Worked under [Rintu Kutum](https://github.com/rintukutum), PhD Student, CSIR-IGIB and used OpenCV for creating a bounding box for the heart of Zebrafish in grayscale videos captured in a controlled environment. Analyzed variations in the segmented regions across the frames to measure the heartbeat of the Zebrafish.
