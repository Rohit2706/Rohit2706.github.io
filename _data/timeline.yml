  • Led the redesign of metadata store replacing Cassandra with RocksDB and scaling support for deep storage with read-heavy workflows from 100 physical nodes to more than 300 nodes.
  • Optimized the iSCSI target digest computation process by introducing a shared locking mechanism resulting in a remarkable decrease in login times and scaling simultaneous logins from 128 targets to 2000+ targets.
  • Pioneered the implementation of a robust network interface hosting mechanism on multiple nodes, providing multi-path IO services to clients, dramatically reducing iSCSIreconnection latencies from 15s to under 1s.
  • Won Nutanix hackathon 2023 forinnovating a snapshot chain management solution over S3,reducing the primary cluster storage requirement to 1/10th saving crucial space for other metadata operations.
  • Led the research paper initiative to foster culture of academic review of innovation in large-scale storage systems.
