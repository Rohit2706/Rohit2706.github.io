               framework for explicitly failing RPC requests for simulation of degraded distributed cluster. Extended 
               the framework for detection of slow nodes with less false positives and minimal overheads for monitoring insights.

  to: July 2019
  description: Worked under Dr. Mitali Mukherjee, Chief Scientist, CSIR-IGIB on phenotypic data consisting of 
               nominal and ordinal features and modeled them into numeric values using entropy function (information 
               theory). Used these values to perform clustering and stratification of healthy individuals into 
               different classes as defined in Ayurveda Sciences. Integrated above models into a web app for 
               data visualization, which is being used by the organization for further research in the field of 
               Precision Medicine.
